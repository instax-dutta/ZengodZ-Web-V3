This project is a web application built with Next.js and React. It utilizes a variety of modern web development technologies and UI libraries to create a rich user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Radix UI**: A library of unstyled, accessible UI primitives.
- **cmdk**:  A command palette component for React.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library.
- **@react-three/fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **@react-three/drei**: A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for `@react-three/fiber`.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3.  **Build for production**:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
